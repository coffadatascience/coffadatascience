- 👋 Hi, I’m @coffadatascience
- 👀 I’m interested in investigation and exploring data coming from different (online) source and using that data to models that lead to understanding and comprehensive insights via hierarchical structuring or visualisation.
- © My experience lies in data architecture and developing algorithms using mostly C#, VB.NET and VBA for coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python programming and command line approaches to support flexible updating of available data sources.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science, data exploration and interesting coding techniques.
- 📫 How to reach me coffadatascience@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: whatever you prefer.
- ⚡ Fun fact: perhaps biological computers are more efficient and fungi have a better internet that we do
